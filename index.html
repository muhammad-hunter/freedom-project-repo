      <p>One of my ideas is a type of software that is a mix of an anti virus and a log of previous actions made on the device and with the account.The anti virus wouldn't be a regular anti virus since this one would update daily to make sure it is up to date with computer viruses since many new viruses come out everyday but we just don't know about them until they are used against us.The anti virus will provide logs about every action made on the device and it will advise on any actions that look suspicious so that the user can check it out if they made that action and if they didn't the software would delete it if its a file and make sure that the file did not send items to other files and to make sure it did not duplicate or make administrative decisions.Finally the antivirus will have bits of machine learning so that it can prevent in advance viruses that you might have had before just like how our immune system works in real life with our body blocking the viruses that we have gotten before with bits of the past virus.The Actual product would be sold in usbs and its main audience would be the average user and computer enthusiasts but with more work it could be made into something made specifically for companies and public computers like the chrome books that many children rely on during these tough times.</p>

      <p>The other creation is software which encrypts the history of the keys you use to prevent keyloggers from stealing your passwords if you a keylogger on your phone and you don't know it.This was inspired from the Identity theft roller that I found when researching items does the internet of things category and it inspired me since I thought this would be perfect in case a third party is watching your screen and if you are using the software it would be unable to decode further protecting you privacy and it encrypts all of your keystrokes.I found out about keyloggers when someone I knew found out that he downloaded a file that contained keyloggers and I wanted to bring a bigger attention to it since not many companies or people speak about it.Both softwares might be made in python or another language which could be better but at this time I would probably say python.This would be sold to the average consumer and It would be donated to schools because I believe children don't need to pay to have a secure device for their school work but it would be available to be purchased online with the software directly downloaded to the device after the transaction.</p>
